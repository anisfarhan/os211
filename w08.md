# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [Process Scheduling](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling.htm)<br>
The process scheduling is the activity of the process manager that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection of another process on the basis of a particular strategy. This is a complete & compact article, I like this one.

2. [CPU Scheduling](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/cpu-scheduling)<br>
CPU scheduling is a process that allows one process to use the CPU while the execution of another process is on hold(in waiting state) due to unavailability of any resource like I/O etc, thereby making full use of CPU. The aim of CPU scheduling is to make the system efficient, fast, and fair.

3. [Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/preemptive-vs-non-preemptive-scheduling.html)<br>
What is Preemptive Scheduling?
Preemptive Scheduling is a scheduling method where the tasks are mostly assigned with their priorities. Sometimes it is important to run a task with a higher priority before another lower priority task, even if the lower priority task is still running.

4. [Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling/)<br>
Non-preemptive Scheduling is used when a process terminates, or a process switches from running to waiting state. In this scheduling, once the resources (CPU cycles) is allocated to a process, the process holds the CPU till it gets terminated or it reaches a waiting state.

5. [Thread Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/thread-scheduling/)<br>
Scheduling of threads involves two boundary scheduling:
- Scheduling of user level threads (ULT) to kernel level threads (KLT) via leightweight process (LWP) by the application developer.
- Scheduling of kernel level threads by the system scheduler to perform different unique os functions.

6. [Multiple-Processor Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiple-processor-scheduling-in-operating-system/)<br>
In multiple-processor scheduling multiple CPUâ€™s are available and hence Load Sharing becomes possible. However multiple processor scheduling is more complex as compared to single processor scheduling.

7. [Priority Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/priority-scheduling-program.html)<br>
Priority Scheduling is a method of scheduling processes that is based on priority. In this algorithm, the scheduler selects the tasks to work as per the priority.

8. [First Come First Serve Scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8)<br>
First Come First Serve (FCFS) is an operating system scheduling algorithm that automatically executes queued requests and processes in order of their arrival. It is the easiest and simplest CPU scheduling algorithm.

9. [Comparison of Scheduling Algorithms](https://unacademy.com/lesson/comparison-of-scheduling-algorithms/BYKW5NJZ)<br>
To sum up the previous links, this video compares all the scheduling algorithms and offers figures, examples, and a clear explanation about each one. It also presents the advantages and disadvantages of each scheduling algorithm.

10. [What is Linux From Scratch?](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/)<br>
Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides you with step-by-step instructions for building your own customized Linux system entirely from source. The last link is the entry to this week main problem :)
