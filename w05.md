# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Virtual Memory vs Physical Memory](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14347206/what-are-the-differences-between-virtual-memory-and-physical-memory)<br>
Virtual memory is (among other things) an abstraction to give the programmer the illusion of having infinite memory available on their system. This discussion forum gives me better understanding about the two.

2. [Demand Paging Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOz3YMfEo1o)<br>
The process of loading page into memory on demand (whenever page fault occurs) is known as demand paging. This video explains the concept behind demand paging.

3. [Belady's Anomaly](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/beladys-anomaly-in-page-replacement-algorithms/)<br>
Belady's anomaly is a phenomenon commonly occured in some page replacement algorithm. This page covers everything essenctial about the anomaly.

4. [Thrashing](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/thrashing-in-operating-system)<br>
Thrashing occurs when a computer's virtual memory resources are overused, leading to a constant state of paging and page faults. The article covers essential concepts of thrashing.

5. [How Does Virtual Memory Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59rEMnKWoS4)<br>
Virtual memory is a feature of an operating system that enables a computer to be able to compensate shortage of physical memory. This video is short and very easy to understand.

6. [Partition Allocation Methods in Memory Management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/partition-allocation-methods-in-memory-management/)<br>
In **Partition Allocation**, when there is more than one partition freely available to accommodate a processâ€™s request, a partition must be selected. This website explains one of four common memory management techniques.

7. [Memory Compression Process in Windows 10](http://woshub.com/memory-compression-process-high-usage-windows-10)<br>
The compressed memory feature in Windows 10 is designed to improve the performance (responsiveness) of the system due to storing part of the memory pages in RAM in a compressed form. The article breaks down compressed memory feature in Windows 10 Anniversary edition (1607).

8. [Android Memory Management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEbKFLbUNzM)<br>
Android doesn't use virtual memory by default, it has a higher-level mechanism. This 11-minutes video explains memory management in android and why it's different with PC desktop.

9. [Non-Uniform Memory Access](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/NUMA-non-uniform-memory-access)<br>
NUMA is a method of configuring a cluster of microprocessor in a multiprocessing system so that they can share memory locally. A short article about NUMA which is mentioned a bit in OSC book slide.

10. [Paging File or Pagefile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VDP5TCAK2c&t=11s)<br>
A paging file is an overflow for your RAM or system memory. This video explains what that means and how to optimize it, in just 5 minutes.
