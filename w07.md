# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [Critical Section Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlGcP-JNxXk)<br>
What is critical section problem? How to deal with it? What solution can answer this problem? This 7-minutes video will give you answers to above questions.

2. [Race Conditions and How to Prevent Them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqnpIwN7dz0&t=4s)<br>
A race condition is an undesirable situation, occurs when a device or system attempts to perform two or more operations at the same time. The video explains well about the definition and the animation makes it more interesting to watch.

3. [What is Semaphore?](https://www.guru99.com/semaphore-in-operating-system.html)<br>
A semaphore is a signaling mechanism, it uses two atomic operation : wait & signal. It's one of the answers for the synchronization problem. This article explains Semaphore little by little with great details.

4. [Readers & Writers Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-SqOuX2Eo)<br>
Another youtube video. The readers-writers problem is a classical problem of process synchronization, it relates to a data set such as a file that is shared between more than one process at a time. 

5. [Dining Philososphers Problem](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/dining-philosophers-problem)<br>
Yet another classical synchronization problem, it is used to evaluate situations where there is a need of allocating multiple resources to multiple process. This articles gives simple explanation about the problem.

6. [Synchronization in Java](https://www.javatpoint.com/synchronization-in-java)<br>
Synchronization in java is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource. This article explains everything we need to know about Java Synchronization.

7. [Spinlock vs Semaphore](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/195853/spinlock-versus-semaphore)<br>
A spinlock is one possible implementation of a lock, namely one that is implemented by busy waiting ("spinning"). A semaphore is a generalization of a lock. This forum gives so much information about the two differences.

8. [Deadlock](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-deadlock-in-operating-system)<br>
Deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process. Geeksforgeeks as always, my number 1 source of information.

9. [Deadlock Prevention](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-deadlock-prevention)<br>
Deadlock is a condition we must avoid at all cost, therefore we have 4 popular solutions prevent deadlock.

10. [Banker's algorithm (an example)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V2FfP_olaA)<br>
The Banker's algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra. This video gives example of the algorithm's application.
