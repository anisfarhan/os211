# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [CrashCourse: Files & File Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN8YgJnShPM)<br>
Are you a deadliner? Do you want to finish your assignment ASAP to continue grinding in your favourite gacha game? or you simply just want a quick read about this week material? Then this video is definitely for you. This 12 minutes video explains briefly about this week material.

2. [What is Linux File System?](https://likegeeks.com/linux-file-system/)<br>
Linux File System or any file system generally is a layer that is under the operating system that handles the positioning of your data on the storage; without it, the system cannot knows which file starts from where and ends where. I like this article because it's simple explanation.

3. [The Ultimate Tar Command Tutorial with 10 Practical Examples](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/04/unix-tar-command-examples/)<br>
In this article, let us review various tar examples including how to create tar archives (with gzip and bzip compression), extract a single file or directory, view tar archive contents, validate the integrity of tar archives, finding out the difference between tar archive and file system, estimate the size of the tar archives before creating it etc. This article helps me understand W03 demos.

4. [FUSE: File Systems in User Space](https://fsgeek.ca/2019/06/18/fuse-file-systems-in-user-space/)<br>
File systems are notoriously difficult to implement: of all the pieces that appear in an operating system, they have the highest quality bar and are often called upon more than almost any other part of the operating system; virtual memory management may be called upon more. After reading this I got better understanding about FUSE.

5. [What is the difference between printf, sprintf and fprintf?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-printf-sprintf-fprintf/)<br>
printf function is used to print character stream of data on stdout console. String print function instead of printing on console store it on char buffer which are specified in sprintf. fprintf is used to print the string content in file but not on stdout console. After compile-run W02 demos, I became curious about printf-sprintf-fprintf, Luckily this article gives me answer.

6. [What Are TAR, GZ, and BZ2?](https://blog.online-convert.com/what-are-tar-gz-and-bz2/)<br>
TAR is short for Tape Archive. It’s a common file format to use in the Unix/Linux world when you need to package source codes. A TAR file is just that, an archive. There’s no compression involved at all. You can think of a TAR file (or a tarball as some prefer to call it) as multiple files taped together. I put this here because I've never heard of these file format names (before this week :p).

7. [Chmod Command in Linux (File Permissions)](https://linuxize.com/post/chmod-command-in-linux/)<br>
In Linux, access to the files is managed through the file permissions, attributes, and ownership. This ensures that only authorized users and processes can access files and directories. This tutorial covers how to use the `chmod` command to change the access permissions of files and directories. An essential part of this week demos is to learn about `chmod` command.

8. [What is a TAR file?](https://www.lifewire.com/tar-file-2622386)<br>
The article explains what TAR files are and how they're different from other archive formats, which programs can extract files from them, and how to convert one to similar archive formats. First heard of TAR file in this week tutorial, and I want to know more about it.

9. [VirtualBox File Locations](http://learn.openwaterfoundation.org/owf-learn-virtualbox/install-host/win/file-locations/)<br>
File locations for VirtualBox software and virtual machines can be confusing. The following is a summary of important file locations on a Windows 10 host computer. This web answers one of my firsts question about VirtualBox: "Where is the real location of VirtualBox data in my computer?".

10. [SSD vs HDD](https://sea.pcmag.com/storage/1526/ssd-vs-hdd-whats-the-difference)<br>
First time using SSD when I have to upgrade my old laptop. Since then I've known the advantages of SSD to HDD, but does it only advantages that SSD have ? This site gives answer to the question, with explaining almost every aspect between SSD & HDD.
