# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [Process Scheduling: Long, Medium, Short Term Scheduler](https://www.guru99.com/process-scheduling.html)<br>
One of this week main material is all about process in operating system, this article gives me better understanding about process scheduling. Process Scheduling is an OS task that schedules processes of different states like ready, waiting, and running.

2. [What is Context Switching in Operating System?](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-context-switching-in-operating-system)<br>
Context switching  is a feature of a multitasking operating system and allows a single CPU to be shared by multiple processes. First heard of context switching within this week materials, this article helped me understand more.

3. [Inter Process Communication (IPC)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inter-process-communication-ipc/)<br>
Processes within a system may be __Independent__ or __Co-operating__. An independent process is not affected by the execution of other processes while a co-operating process can be affected by other executing processes. This article explains about Inter Process Communication with details.

4. [What is Race Condition?](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/race-condition)<br>
A race condition is an undesirable situation that occurs when a device or system attempts to perform two or more operations at the same time. I like this article because it's nice and short.

5. [What is Multicore Programming?](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-multicore-programming)<br>
Multicore programming helps to create concurrent systems for deployment on multicore processor and multiprocessor systems. A multicore processor system is basically a single processor with multiple execution cores in one chip. This article gives website gives short simple explanation about multicore programming.

6. [Concurrency vs. Parallelism](https://medium.com/@itIsMadhavan/concurrency-vs-parallelism-a-brief-review-b337c8dac350)<br>
A medium article which gives me brief & simple comparison between the two. Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.

7. [Amdahlâ€™s law and its proof](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-organization-amdahls-law-and-its-proof/)<br>
We've known Amdahl's law since semester 1 in PSD class, but have we ever try to prove it ? This site gives us the proofing of Amdahl's law.

8. [User Level Trhead vs Kernel Level Thread](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-user-level-thread-and-kernel-level-thread/)<br>
A table of comparison between user level thread & kernel level thread. Threads are broadly classified as user level threads and kernel level threads based on their domain of execution.

9. [Multithreading Models in Operating System](https://binaryterms.com/multithreading-models-in-operating-system.html)<br>
Multithreading Models in Operating System exhibit the ways of mapping the user threads to the kernel threads. On this site, we will learn about the three multithreading models: Many to One model, One to One model and Many to Many model. I put this here because it helped answers this week's Pop Quiz :P.

10. [Fork System Call](https://linuxhint.com/fork-system-call-linux/)<br>
Fork is a function I just learned this week during first meeting on Wednesday. The fork system call is used to create a new processes. The newly created process is the child process. The process which calls fork and creates a new process is the parent process. The child and parent processes are executed concurrently.
